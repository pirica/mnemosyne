"""Regression tests for E3 — additive sleep().

Pre-E3 contract: BeamMemory.sleep() consolidated old working_memory rows
into an episodic_memory summary and then DELETED the source rows. The
new contract (per maintainer decision 2026-05-10: "Kill summarize-and-
delete. Originals stay.") is additive:

  - Source working_memory rows REMAIN after sleep
  - A new `consolidated_at` TIMESTAMP column on working_memory is set on
    the rows sleep processed
  - sleep() doesn't pick up rows that already have consolidated_at set
    (so calling sleep twice doesn't double-summarize the same originals)
  - Recall surfaces both the original working_memory row AND the
    episodic summary row when both are relevant

This blocks experiment Arm B (ADD-only ingest) of the BEAM-recovery
experiment.
